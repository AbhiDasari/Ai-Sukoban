This is a Python code for generating Sokoban puzzle levels. Sokoban is a puzzle game in which a player moves crates onto goal squares in a warehouse. The generated levels are based on ASCII characters.

The code imports several libraries, including a library of agents (DoNothingAgent, RandomAgent, BFSAgent, DFSAgent, AStarAgent, HillClimberAgent, GeneticAgent, MCTSAgent) that can be used to evaluate the generated levels.

The code creates an empty Sokoban level with a given width and height, and initializes the level with walls and floors. A function is defined to generate a random position for the player and crates in the level. Another function is defined to generate the Sokoban level itself, using the empty level and the random positions of the player and crates.

The code then generates a solution to the Sokoban level using an A* agent, and updates the level to include the solution path. Finally, the code generates a set number of levels and outputs them to a specified directory.
